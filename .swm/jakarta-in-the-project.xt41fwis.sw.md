title: Jakarta in the Project
---
This document will cover the following aspects of Jakarta in the context of the DEMO-camunda-bpm-platform project:

1. The role of Jakarta in the project.
2. Where Jakarta is implemented in the codebase.

# Role of Jakarta

Jakarta, specifically the `jakarta.jakartaee-bom` artifact in the `jakarta.platform` group, is a key dependency in the `engine-rest-jakarta` module of the project. It provides the necessary libraries and specifications for the Jakarta EE platform, which is a set of specifications that enable development of enterprise applications.

# Implementation of Jakarta

The `jakarta.jakartaee-bom` artifact is declared as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of the `engine-rest-jakarta` module. The version of the Jakarta EE specifications used is determined by the `${version.jakarta-ee-spec}` property.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
      <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-bom</artifactId>
      <version>${version.jakarta-ee-spec}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
```
