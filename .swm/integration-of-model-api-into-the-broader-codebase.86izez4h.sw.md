title: Integration of model-api into the Broader Codebase
---
This document will cover the interaction of the model-api with the broader Camunda engine and its embedding into the larger codebase. We'll cover:

1. The role of the model-api in the Camunda engine
2. How the model-api is embedded into the larger codebase

# Role of the model-api in the Camunda engine

The model-api is a crucial part of the Camunda engine. It provides the XML model API written in Java, which is used to define and manipulate the BPMN models. This is evident from the `camunda-xml-model` document.

# Embedding of the model-api into the larger codebase

The `Bpmn` class in the model-api provides access to the Camunda BPMN model API. It includes methods for reading a `BpmnModelInstance` from a file or an input stream, and for writing a `BpmnModelInstance` to a file or an output stream. This class is used throughout the codebase, indicating how the model-api is embedded into the larger codebase.

```java
/**
 * <p>Provides access to the camunda BPMN model api.</p>
 *
 * @author Daniel Meyer
 *
 */
public class Bpmn {

  /** the singleton instance of {@link Bpmn}. If you want to customize the behavior of Bpmn,
   * replace this instance with an instance of a custom subclass of {@link Bpmn}. */
  public static Bpmn INSTANCE = new Bpmn();

  /** the parser used by the Bpmn implementation. */
  private BpmnParser bpmnParser = new BpmnParser();
  private final ModelBuilder bpmnModelBuilder;

  /** The {@link Model}
   */
  private Model bpmnModel;

  /**
```
