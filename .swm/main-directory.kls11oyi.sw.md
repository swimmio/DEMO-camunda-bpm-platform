This document will cover the topic of 'Main' in the context of the DEMO-camunda-bpm-platform repository. We'll cover:

1. The role of 'Main' in the codebase
2. The implementation of 'Main' in the codebase.

# Role of Main in the Codebase

In the context of this repository, 'Main' refers to the main directory where the source code of the project resides. It is the root directory for the source code of the project. The 'Main' directory is crucial as it contains all the necessary code files and resources required for the project to function correctly.

# Implementation of Main in the Codebase

This is an example of a file located in the 'Main' directory. This specific file, 'EmptyBodyFilter.java', is part of the 'org.camunda.bpm.engine.rest.filter' package. It extends the 'AbstractEmptyBodyFilter' class and overrides several methods. This file is a good representation of the type of code you can expect to find in the 'Main' directory.
