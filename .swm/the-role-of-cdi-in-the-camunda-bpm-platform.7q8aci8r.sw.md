---
This document will cover the role of CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) in the Camunda BPM Platform. We'll cover:

1. What is CDI
2. How CDI is used in Camunda BPM Platform

# What is CDI

CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) is a standard dependency injection framework included in Java EE 6 and later versions. It allows developers to use enterprise-level features such as transactions, security, and remote access in their applications.

# How CDI is used in Camunda BPM Platform

In the context of the Camunda BPM Platform, CDI plays a crucial role in enabling developers to write Java Applications that interact with running processes. It is part of the programming model integration, along with Spring, as mentioned in the `README.md` file. This integration allows for seamless interaction between the application's components and the Camunda Engine, which is responsible for executing BPMN 2.0 processes.
