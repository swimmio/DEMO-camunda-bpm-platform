# Assigning Tasks to Users

The `TaskQuery` interface provides methods for querying tasks. The `taskId` method is used to select tasks with a given task id, while the `taskAssignee` and `taskAssigneeIn` methods are used to select tasks assigned to a specific user or users respectively. These methods are used in various parts of the codebase to assign tasks to users.

```java
  TaskQuery taskId(String taskId);

  /**
   * Only select tasks with the given task ids.
   */
  TaskQuery taskIdIn(String... taskIds);

  /**
   * Only select tasks with the given name.
   * The query will match the names of tasks in a case-insensitive way.
   */
  TaskQuery taskName(String name);

  /**
   * Only select tasks with a name not matching the given name/
   * The query will match the names of tasks in a case-insensitive way.
   */
  TaskQuery taskNameNotEqual(String name);

  /**
   * Only select tasks with a name matching the parameter.
```
