title: Overview of Models
---
This document will delve into the topic of Models in the engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/models directory. We'll cover:

1. The role and functionality of Models
2. Where Models are implemented in the codebase.

# Role and Functionality of Models

Models in the context of the Camunda Platform are representations of various entities and processes within the system. They are used to encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on this data. They play a crucial role in the process automation and workflow management capabilities of the platform.

# Implementation of Models

Models are implemented throughout the codebase, particularly within the engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/models directory. This directory contains various subdirectories, each representing a different model. For instance, the 'org' subdirectory contains models related to organizational entities.
