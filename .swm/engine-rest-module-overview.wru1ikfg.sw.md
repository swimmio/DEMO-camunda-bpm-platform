# Role and Functionality of EngineRestApplication

The EngineRestApplication class is a key component of the engine-rest module. It extends the Application class and overrides the getClasses method. This method returns a set of classes that provide named process engine access and configuration classes for the Camunda REST API.

```java
/**
 * The engine rest api exposed by the application.
 *
 * @author nico.rehwaldt
 */
public class EngineRestApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public Set<Class<?>> getClasses() {
    Set<Class<?>> classes = new HashSet<Class<?>>();

    // only provide named process engine access.
    classes.add(NamedProcessEngineRestServiceImpl.class);

    // mandatory
    classes.addAll(CamundaRestResources.getConfigurationClasses());

    return classes;
  }
}
```

# Usage of EngineRestApplication

The EngineRestApplication class is registered as a servlet in the CamundaBpmWebappInitializer class. This allows the engine-rest API to be exposed at the '/api/engine/\*' path.

```java
    registerServlet("Engine Api", EngineRestApplication.class,
        applicationPath + "/api/engine/*");
```

# Structure and Content of engine-rest Directory

The engine-rest directory contains several subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose. The engine-rest/src directory contains the source code for the engine-rest module. The engine-rest-openapi directory contains templates and resources for the OpenAPI specification of the engine-rest API.
