title: BPMN Instance in Codebase
---
This document will cover the functionality and usage of BPMN Instance in the DEMO-camunda-bpm-platform codebase. We'll cover:

1. The role of BPMN Instance in the codebase
2. Where BPMN Instance is implemented

# Role of BPMN Instance

BPMN Instance in the DEMO-camunda-bpm-platform codebase is a crucial part of the BPMN model. It represents an instance of a BPMN model element, which could be any element defined in the BPMN 2.0 specification. This includes tasks, events, gateways, and so on. The BPMN Instance provides a way to interact with these elements programmatically, allowing for manipulation and inspection of BPMN processes.

# Implementation of BPMN Instance

The `BpmnModelElementInstance` is a key part of the BPMN Instance implementation. It provides the base for all BPMN elements in the model.

```java
package org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.instance;

import org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.builder.AbstractBaseElementBuilder;
```

The `Task` class is an example of a BPMN Instance. It represents a task element in a BPMN process.

```java
package org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.instance;

import org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.instance.bpmndi.BpmnShape;
```
