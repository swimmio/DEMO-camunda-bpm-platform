title: XML Model
---
This document will cover the following aspects of XML Model in the DEMO-camunda-bpm-platform repo:

1. The role of XML Model in the codebase
2. How XML Model is implemented and used in the codebase

# Role of XML Model

XML Model in the DEMO-camunda-bpm-platform repo is a crucial component for handling XML-based process definitions and transformations. It provides the necessary infrastructure for parsing, creating, and manipulating XML documents in a way that is aligned with the BPMN 2.0 standard.

# Implementation and Usage of XML Model

The <SwmPath>[model-api/xml-model/src/main/java/org/camunda/bpm/model/xml/Model.java](/model-api/xml-model/src/main/java/org/camunda/bpm/model/xml/Model.java)</SwmPath> file is a key part of the XML Model. It provides the interface for a model which can be a BPMN 2.0, CMMN 1.1, or DMN 1.1 model. This interface is used throughout the codebase for operations related to these models.

The `AbstractModelParser.java` file is another important part of the XML Model. It provides the base class for all model parsers. The `javax.xml.XMLConstants` package is imported here, which provides a host of XML-related constants used in parsing operations.

```java
import java.util.Map;

import javax.xml.XMLConstants;
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException;
```

The `ModelElementInstanceImpl.java` file is part of the XML Model's implementation. It provides the base class for all model element instances. The `org.camunda.bpm.model.xml.Model` package is imported here, which is used for operations related to the model.

```java
import java.util.Set;

import org.camunda.bpm.model.xml.Model;
import org.camunda.bpm.model.xml.ModelBuilder;
import org.camunda.bpm.model.xml.ModelException;
```
